# Strain Smart

## Description
> Have you ever gone to the dispensary and felt completely overwhelmed with all of the options or maybe rushed through the process? Or maybe you got home and totally forgot what the budtender told you? 

This application is designed to fill the gap between dispensary visits and users consuming marijuana products. It aims to educate consumers on the genetics, effects, and flavors of a given strain. Simply enter the strain name into the search bar, hit go, and we'll help you get a wee[d] bit smarter!
